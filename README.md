# Machine Learning

Welcome to this repository where I will record Python notebooks that cover introductory notes on machine learning. Each notebook will focus on a specific topic, such as classification problems, regression problems, or neural networks. My main objectives are to gain a deep understanding of machine learning principles and learn how to implement the most common Python libraries for machine learning.

My approach will be straightforward and geared towards deploying machine learning methods to tackle simple, concrete problems. These notebooks will prioritize the applications and won't delve into the mathematical and statistical foundations supporting the effectiveness and convergence of the machine learning techniques.

As I progress in my learning journey, I will continue to take notes and share more notebooks ...


## Background

_Machine learning_ is a domain within _artificial intelligence_ and _computer science_. It harnesses statistical and mathematical results to develop methods that transform data into solutions for a wide variety of problems. These problems typically fall into three groups, depending on the data available: [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning), and [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).

_Supervised learning_ deals with tasks such as recognizing hand-written digits, classifying images into "dogs" or "cats", and interpolating or predicting functions. Supervised learning problems can be further divided into [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) and [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) problems.  I'll explore solving a classification problem in `ML - classification problems.ipynb` and a regression problem in `ML - regression problems.ipynb`.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention _neural networks_ or _deep learning_ in the paragraphs above. That's because these methods can actually be applied to address all the problems mentioned earlier. In fact, [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) is an area within machine learning, where one uses certain types of [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to tackle various challenges. In the notebook `ML - neural networks.ipynb`, I'll provide an introduction to neural networks and show their effectiveness in solving both regression and classification problems.
